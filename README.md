## Planning and Development

1.  Come up with an idea for a full stack project!
1.  Write user stories.
1.  Design the Entity Relationship Diagram
1.  Develop the app by using the analysis and design as input to write code.
1.  Get plenty of help from fellow developers and consultants!
1.  Test the app at various levels of development, and after.
1.  Bug fix.

## Unsolved problems

The app is not mobile.
Initially the plan was to be able to swap CDs and records too over the app. But
I had to limit it to just books for now, to eliminate a table, and meet
deadline.
Real-time chat to communicate with other users(hoping there is a third party
API)
Making it available to buy books.
